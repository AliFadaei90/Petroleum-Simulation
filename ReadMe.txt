In this study, first, a model of a gas tank is simulated by "CMG" software to obtain time pressure data, and then this data is analyzed by "Ecrin" software to calculate the 
Skin effect and In both Darcy flow and non-Darcy flow, the Skin effect is obtained. 
Then, to analyze the sensitivity of four parameters, flow rate, 
well radius, porosity and permeability "DOE" Software considered investigating the effect of changes in each of those parameters separately in Darcy and non-Darcy modes due to the Skin.
Python is very convenient for Normalizing big data before importing them to "DOE" software.
Finally, the non-Darcy flow and the sensitivity of the non-Darcy flow coefficient and turbulence coefficient to the said parameters are investigated.
